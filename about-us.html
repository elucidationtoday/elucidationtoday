                    <p>"It was the month of February and the results of Class X Pre-Boards were out. We were now required to fill the form indicating the streams we wanted. My teachers, relatives, parents and friends threw a lot of suggestions at me but I wasn’t clear as to<span class="rest_content" id="rest_content_1"> what I wanted to do.<br><br><b>[two years later]</b><br>I was staring at the marksheet of class XII which I held in my hands. I had studied five subjects. I did not know which subject I was more interested in and which college I wanted to go to. I simply enrolled in a college that my parents thought was good for me. There they would ask me, “So Avnie, what do you want to become in life?” I did not have the answer to this question even as I completed my Bachelor’s degree.<br><br>
                    <b>[fast forward]</b> <br>The results of graduation were out. My name was in the toppers’ list yet again as I had scored top marks across all the colleges of my university. I had studied five subjects in these three years: Psychology, Political Science, Economics, English, Punjabi. I still did not know what I wanted to do next! I liked Psychology, but at the last moment, a SWOT analysis led me to go for a Master’s degree in Economics. <br><br>
                    <b>[moving on]</b> <br>I was appearing to interview for the Young India Fellowship. They ask me something along the lines of what my aim in life was. I confidently answered, 'I am committed to making students aware of the career options that they have. I want to assist them in choosing the right field. I aim to create a platform for skill development so when a person embarks on the journey called ‘career’, they are fully equipped to pursue their dreams.'"</span><span class="read_more" onclick="readmore('1')" id="read_more_1">&nbsp;read more...</span></p>

                    <p>"Since class XI (and since 1st year of junior college), I have been studying Computer Science.<br><br>

After I completed my schooling and entered a new institution called College, I realized that <span class="rest_content" id="rest_content_2">it is not one bit similar to what they show in the movies! Jokes apart, as my college life began, I came across this term called ‘internship’. Yes, I am from Delhi and I didn’t know what an internship was. Sounds weird? It was a living reality for me, and for a lot of friends and batchmates. Somehow I comprehended that internships help you get a job after college, and it got me thinking whether I should get one. I started my journey but soon realised that they asked for some skills, which I did not have. I only knew how to create a program to implement stacks and queues. This too was recently taught to me in class. Thus, I stopped looking for one especially after seeing that a lot of my friends were not doing it either.<br><br>

I went on to do a Master’s in Computer Science afterwards and then thought it would be easy to get a job without any prior experience, but alas! A degree is not enough to get a job; it just glorifies your wall! You have to have some practical knowledge if you are out there looking for a job. I struggled for some time to get a job and decided that this should not happen to my lovely juniors, friends, and anybody for that matter.<br><br>

Finally, I'm now here at Elucidation Today, for skill development, career awareness, and to help you draw the map to your dreams!"</span><span class="read_more" onclick="readmore('2')" id="read_more_2">&nbsp;read more...</span></p>

                    <p>"Be it physics, chemistry or biology, Science subjects have been my favourite since school. I was really curious and fascinated to learn real-time applications of basic science. My Science classes were really thought-provoking. I used to share my explorations with my sister and used to tell her that I'd go for some science course <span class="rest_content" id="rest_content_3">in college. <br><br>

By the time the results of my school exams were out, I was pondering what to do next. My only points of contact to learn about courses were my teachers at school, and my family. Thanks to the Akshaya centre near my home, I started searching for courses online as well. Then something struck me. It was a course on oceanography. Wow! It would be really wonderful to study about oceans and waves, I thought. But when I presented that to my parents, the response was not very positive since they hadn’t heard about such a course. They suggested that I go for either engineering or medical education, which were common courses they were aware of. Not being privileged enough to learn further about higher education and career opportunities, and living in a village area where there were very few opportunities to explore things, I couldn’t get much information on a course that I found interesting. I then decided to go for engineering but had this hard feeling of not being able to explore my interest areas.<br><br>

I was, however, a bit relieved when I saw that I got my first option, Biotechnology Engineering in the first allotment of the engineering admission process in my state. However, we were confused about the career options that the course opened up. Considering the financial condition of my family at that time I cancelled my first option and joined a Computer Science and Engineering course in a government college. Little did I know that I could grab a scholarship and pursue Biotechnology at the time. With time, the disappointment subsided, only to return when I learnt about the research options after pursuing education in Biotechnology Engineering.<br><br>

I used to often think that my life would have changed if I had somebody to enlighten me about career choices. Thus, throughout my college days I tried to interact with as many people as possible to learn from them about various opportunities, so that I could guide and help students from my village and my fellow relatives in fulfilling their career dreams. I also used to think of how privileged people are to decide wise career options, that too according to their aptitude. That was the same thing that struck me when my friend mentioned about this idea, her brainchild. I thought by being part of this endeavour, I could help not just the people I know but anyone who wants to go after their dreams."</span><span class="read_more" onclick="readmore('3')" id="read_more_3">&nbsp;read more...</span></p>

                    <p>As a kid, I was so much fascinated with cars and bikes that I wanted to become a mechanical engineer and work with those big boy toys. But after spending a year as a science student after my boards I realized I don't enjoy Physics. But I was already stuck in the quicksand and <span class="rest_content" id="rest_content_5">there was no going back from here. Screwed up my XII Boards big time. Did not want to go for Btech and had no vision what so ever on what else I could do. Thankfully I had a sweet corner for maths and economics since I was 13. I of course did not understand the intricacies but loved the idea about economics.<br>Did not waste a single minute and took admission to economics in my UG. It was a tough road and I seriously had no idea that what I would do or what I want to pursue after I complete my UG. That's where a thought pop "I wish I could build something for people where they would get all the help about careers and everything which I didn't have access too". But due to lack of exposure and knowledge building and working on something like this faded.<br><br>As I approached my third year I figured out there is a lot to learn in this particular subject and luckily got a mentor who had a degree in economics and started preparing for Masters. Due to less exposure and guidance, I was way back than my competitors. Finally, after working hard day and night for 2 years I got into a good Grad School. I have worked 3 folds more than what is required for where I am now. I am sure I would have where I am today or at a better place quicker if I had the right people at the right time.<br><br>I came across a post about ELUCIDATION TODAY, I read about the vision and idea and couldn't believe that opportunity has come to my door knocking. The thought of helping and mentoring students which I had three years ago but couldn't pursue it has come to a reality where I can join this platform and help people. I hope to make people more employable and find and choose their career path without a single drop of confusion.</span><span class="read_more" onclick="readmore('5')" id="read_more_5">&nbsp;read more...</span></p>
