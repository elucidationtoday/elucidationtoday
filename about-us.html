                    <p>"It was the month of February and the results of the pre-board examination of class X were out. It was time to opt for the streams now. Avnie was unclear as to what to go for despite suggestions by teachers, relatives, parents and friends.<span class="rest_content" id="rest_content_1"><br><br>[two years later] Avnie was staring at the mark-sheet of class XII.<br>She had studied five subjects in class XII and still did not know which subject she was interested in and which college to go to. So, she took admission in a college that her parents thought was good for her. There, they would ask her, “So Avnie, what do you want to become in life?” She did not have the answer to this question even as she completed her Bachelor’s degree. The result of graduation was out. Her name was in the toppers’ list yet again. She had studied five subjects in these three years and still did not know what to do next! She liked Psychology but a last moment SWOT analysis led her to go for a Master’s degree in Economics.<br><br>[moving on] She is appearing for an interview at Young India Fellowship. They ask her something along the lines of what was her aim in life. She confidently answers, “I am committed to making students aware of the career options that they have, I aim at creating a platform for skill development so that when a person embarks on the journey called ‘career’, they are fully equipped to pursue their dreams.

            <p>"Since class XI (and since 1st year of junior college for those from Mumbai 😜), Abhishek has been studying Computer Science.<span class="rest_content" id="rest_content_2"><br><br>Upon entering a new institution called College, he realized that it is not one bit similar to what they show in the movies! Jokes apart, as his college life began, he came across another term called ‘internship’. Yes, he is from Delhi and he didn’t know what an internship was. Sounds weird? But it was a living reality for him, and for a lot of friends and batchmates. With time, he comprehended that an internship helps one get a job after college. This got him thinking that even he should get an Internship. He started his journey but soon realized that companies asked for some skills, which he did not have. He only knew how to create a program to implement stacks and queues. This too was recently taught to him in class. So he stopped looking for internships especially after seeing that a lot of his friends were not going for it either.<br><br>He went on to do a Master's in Computer Science afterwards and thought that now it would be easy to get a job without any prior experience, but damn! A degree is not enough to get a job; it just glorifies your wall! You have to have some practical knowledge if you are out there looking for a job. He struggled for some time to get a job and decided that this should not happen to his lovely juniors, friends, and anybody for that matter.<br><br>And elucidation today is here, for skill development, career awareness, and to help you draw the map to your dreams!"</span><span class="read_more" onclick="readmore('2')" id="read_more_2">&nbsp;read more...</span></p>

                    <p>"Be it physics, chemistry or biology, Science subjects were her favourite since school. The real-time applications of basic Science fascinated her. She would share her explorations with her sister and used to tell her that she will go for some science course <span class="rest_content" id="rest_content_3">in college. <br><br>
By the time the school exams were over and the results were out, she was pondering what to do next. Her only points of contact to learn about the courses were the teachers at school, and the family. Thanks to the Akshaya centre near her home, she started searching for courses online as well. That is when she came across a course on oceanography. Wow! It would be wonderful to study oceans and waves, she thought. But, her parents did not respond positively to that since they hadn’t heard of such a course. They suggested she go for either engineering or medical education. Being not privileged to learn further about higher education and career opportunities and living in a village area where there were very few opportunities to explore things, she couldn’t get much information on a course that she found interesting. She then decided to go for engineering but had this hard feeling of not being able to explore her interests.<br><br>
She was a bit relieved when she saw that she got her first option, Biotechnology Engineering, in the first allotment of the engineering admission process in her state. Unaware of the career options of the course and considering the financial condition of the family at that time, she cancelled her first option and joined Computer Science and Engineering course in a government college. Little did she know that she could grab a scholarship and pursue Biotechnology at that time. With time, the disappointment subsided, only to return when she learnt about the research options after pursuing education in Biotechnology Engineering.<br><br>
She used to often think that her life would have changed if somebody had enlightened her about career choices. Thus, throughout her college days, she tried to interact with as many people as possible to learn about various opportunities, to guide and help students from her village and her fellow relatives in fulfilling their career dreams. She would think of how privileged people decide wise career options, that too according to their aptitude. That was the same thing that struck her when her friend mentioned this idea, her brainchild. She thought that by being part of this endeavour, she could help not just the people she knows but anyone who wants to go after their dreams."</span><span class="read_more" onclick="readmore('3')" id="read_more_3">&nbsp;read more...</span></p>
